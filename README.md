E-Commerce Fraud Detection Model

*I. Problem Statement*

E-commerce platforms process thousands of transactions every day, and a small but significant portion of these transactions are fraudulent. Fraudulent transactions lead to direct financial losses, increased chargebacks, and reduced customer trust.

This is a synthethic dataset, only about 5% of transactions are fraudulent, making fraud detection a highly imbalanced, binary classification problem. Traditional accuracy-based models may fail because they tend to favor the majority (non-fraud) class and miss fraudulent activities.

Objective: Build a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent e-commerce transactions using customer and transaction data, while handling class imbalance effectively and maximizing the detection of fraud cases.
